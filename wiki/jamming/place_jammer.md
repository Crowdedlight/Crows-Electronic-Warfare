## How to place such a jammer

```admonish info
Putting a jammer on an object already having a jammer will override the previous jammer. Each object can only have a single jammer.
```

```admonish warning
A lot of antenna objects are not destructable and as such you cannot blow them up to destroy the jammer. If you want to be able to blow up the jammer with explosives or rockets make sure to use a destructable object or the default dataterminal the module can spawn.
```

### Zeus interface

4. Sync the object (3D model) you have chosen as the area denial jammer to the object you just placed on the map.

```admonish info
If you want to use a Data Terminal object, search for the `Data Terminal (destructible)` version. Only the destructible version has animations enabled and is possible to blow up/destroy. If you use the basegame version that is just called "Data Terminal", then you will not get the animations and it is impossible to destroy. 
```

5. Once done you should see a blue line between the 3D model and the jammer module.
