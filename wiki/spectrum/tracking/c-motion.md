# C-motion

The C-motion is an item players can carry in their backpacks and deploy in the world to act as a motion-sensor.

When any unit moves within the sensor radius of the C-motion, the device will alert the user that placed it. The alert can be configured as:

* A [Spectrum frequency signal](spectrum/basic-use.md)
* A map-marker (with optional time-stamp)
* An audio cue

The availability of these configuration options can be individually disabled in the server settings.
