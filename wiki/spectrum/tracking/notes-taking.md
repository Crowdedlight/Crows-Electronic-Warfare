# Taking notes
Dependent on how challenging a signal is to track, or how many of those there are, it can be helpful to take notes of previous tracking results.




## Controls
**Space:** Draw a line on the map
  - from your current position to where the Spectrum Device is currently pointing to
  - put a marker with the *currently selected frequency* next to the player's position

You can use a different color for both the line and marker by additionally pressing one of the following keys:
  - **Ctrl** 
  - **Shift** 
  - **Alt** 

To change the controls edit the CBA key bindings under `Controls > Configure Addons > Crows Electronic Warfare` (search for the term *Spectrum Autoline* there).



## Tactical use
When players point at the same signal from different positions, and take notes/lines of those measurements, there is a chance of those lines intersecting.
**The likely position of the signal source is where the lines intersect.**
(This can also be done cooperatively with Spectrum Device users of other friendly elements that are located somewhere else. Their lines however need to be put manually on the map.)

### Tracking multiple signals simultaneously
To take notes for different signals, use different colors on the map.
This makes it easier to separate all the lines on the map.
